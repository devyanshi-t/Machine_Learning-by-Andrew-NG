# Assignment 1 : Week 2


##  Warm Up excersise 
Return a 5X5 indentity matrix<br/>
##  Linear Regression with one variable<br/>
1. Plot the data<br/>
2. Add intercept<br/>
3. Calculate cost function at theta=0 <br/>
4. Use gradient descent<br/>
5. predict the values for 35000 and 70000
6. plot the line of best fit

## Multi variable linear regression

The file ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Port- land, Oregon. <br/>The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.<br/>

1. Feature Normalization <br/>

 Subtract the mean value of each feature from the dataset.<br/>
 After subtracting the mean, additionally scale (divide) the feature values by their respective “standard deviations.”<br/>

2. Implement Gradient descent <br/>

3. Adjust your learning rate and plot no .of iterations vs cost plot to check if gradient descent is working properly<br/>

4. Apply normal equation to calculate theta.
